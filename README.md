## Getting Started

Follow the steps below, after cloning the project:

### üñê Requirements

- Node
- Yarn
- Docker
- Skaffold (Handles the workflow for building, pushing and deploying your kubernetes application)

### ‚è≥ Installation

- (Use **docker** to run the project locally (must). [Install docker with these docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

- (Use **skaffold** to run the project locally (must). [Install skaffold with these docs](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/)

```bash
skaffold dev
```

**Note - Use the following command to create .env secrets `kubectl create secret generic [secret-name] --from-literal=[secret-key]=[secret-value]`. For example `kubectl create secret generic JwtTokenKey --from-literal=JWT_KEY=XYZ`**

This command will start up all the above mentioned services at once by going through kubernetes files in `./infrastructure/k8s` directory and download all the docker images from dockerhub required to run the application locally.
